    "text": "I have been fascinated by nature for as long as I can remember, with David Attenborough’s documentaries serving as my earliest and most inspiring source of curiosity about the natural world. I began birdwatching in 2018 — a hobby that has since evolved into my main academic focus, as birds have become my primary study group. This passion led me to pursue studies in ecological and evolutionary biology, which remain at the core of my scientific interests. I am currently a Master’s student of Ecology at Charles University in Prague, working under the supervision of Prof. Vladimír Remeš.\nI draw inspiration from scientists such as E. O. Wilson, Jared Diamond, Richard Feynman, and Vojtěch Novotný, whose work continues to shape my perspective on the diversity and complexity of life. Beyond research, I enjoy exploring topics in politics, history, and sociology. I am also passionate about jazz music — I play drums and percussion, dance swing, and can sometimes be found at my favorite Prague jazz club, U Malého Glena."

Building on this framework, my master’s thesis will focus on the ecology and evolution of local syntopy in North American passerines using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), a standardised large-scale monitoring programme.\nThe central hypothesis is that local syntopy is promoted by ecological divergence, particularly in resource use, and that the influence of such predictors differs between spatial scales.
